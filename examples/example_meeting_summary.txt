Quick recap
The team aligned on the pilot analysis plan for the MeerKAT continuum sample. Priya confirmed the data ingest pipeline is running again after the storage migration, and Alex volunteered to draft the observing-note template. Everyone agreed to capture the calibration issues from the last semester in a lessons-learned doc before the internal review.
Next steps
Priya: Circulate the ingest status report to the mailing list by Friday
Alex: Draft the observing-note template and share it for comments
Jack: Compile calibration lessons learned into the shared document
Yusuf: Propose dates for the internal review before the next call
Summary
Pipeline Health Check
Priya walked through the fresh ingest metrics and highlighted lingering slowdowns on two nodes; the ops team will monitor throughput for the next 72 hours and escalate if rates dip again.
Observing-Note Template
Alex suggested a concise template covering pointing setup, calibrator health, and immediate follow-up actions. The group approved the outline and asked for a filled-in example ahead of the next session.
Calibration Lessons Learned
Jack will consolidate the recurring flux-scale variances into the shared document so the group can prioritise which fixes to bake into the July run. Priya requested an explicit checklist item to confirm bandpass stability.
