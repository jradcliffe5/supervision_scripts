### Agenda
- Pipeline Health Check
- Observing-Note Template
- Calibration Lessons Learned

### Discussion notes
- Quick recap: The team aligned on the pilot analysis plan for the MeerKAT continuum sample.; Priya confirmed the data ingest pipeline is running again after the storage migration, and Alex volunteered to draft the observing-note template.; Everyone agreed to capture the calibration issues from the last semester in a lessons-learned doc before the internal review.
- Pipeline Health Check: Priya walked through the fresh ingest metrics and highlighted lingering slowdowns on two nodes; the ops team will monitor throughput for the next 72 hours and escalate if rates dip again.
- Observing-Note Template: Alex suggested a concise template covering pointing setup, calibrator health, and immediate follow-up actions. The group approved the outline and asked for a filled-in example ahead of the next session.
- Calibration Lessons Learned: Jack will consolidate the recurring flux-scale variances into the shared document so the group can prioritise which fixes to bake into the July run. Priya requested an explicit checklist item to confirm bandpass stability.
